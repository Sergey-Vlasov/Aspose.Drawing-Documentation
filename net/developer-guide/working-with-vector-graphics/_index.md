Aspose.Drawing for .NET makes it easy for you to draw vector graphics using C#. The API lets you work with a variety of different vector graphics such as arcs, Bezier spline, Cardinal Spline, closed curves, ellipses, lines and aÂ  number of other types. This article contains C# examples for drawing different types of vector graphics using the API.
## **Draw Arc**
To drawn an arc using C#,

1. Instantiate an object of Bitmap class
1. Initialize an object of Graphics class from this bitmap
1. Define a Pen object with desired parameters
1. Use the DrawArc method of Graphics class object to draw an arc

## **Draw Bezier Spline**
1. Instantiate an object of Bitmap class
1. Initialize an object of Graphics class from this bitmap
1. Define a Pen object with desired parameters
1. Use the DrawBezier method of Graphics class object to draw Bezier Spline
